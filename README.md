# Project-MVVM
Getting started with software architectural pattern MVVM.

- MVVM is one of the best way to structure code (in most situations). 
- It is the compartmentalization of the various components in a project. 
- The UI components are kept away from the business logic.
- The business logic is kept away from the database operations.
- It's easy to read (because everything has specific places to live)
And if done correctly, you have a lot less to worry about when it comes to lifecycle events (ex: screen rotations)
